# Juan David | Frontend developer 

Having a graphic design background I code responsive, accessible UI with performance and SEO in mind. I work across WordPress and React, translating design systems into clean components.

These links show projects I worked on as a contractor through agencies. I do not claim ownership of the client relationship; my part was limited to the work and time I was involved. Please note that live sites may have changed since my involvement.

## Freelance work

Agency building WordPress sites for multiple clients. I handled front-end styling and system setup (typograpy, color palette, spacing, breakpoints and interactive states), made layouts responsive, and set up/tuned components to match design across devices.


## WordPress projects
### NYC Media Responsive

These were short and fast paced projects, no communication channel with the design team, designs were provided and excecuted as they came.
