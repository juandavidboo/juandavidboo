# Juan David | Frontend developer 

Having a graphic design background I code responsive, accessible UI with performance and SEO in mind. I work across WordPress and React, translating design systems into clean components. This portfolio highlights team projects I helped ship at agencies and in-house.

I’m compiling public URLs of projects I contributed to, listed under the hiring company/agency. They owned the client relationship; I contributed as a contractor. I’m not claiming ownership, only my scope and time frame. Live sites may have changed since delivery.

## Freelance work

Agency building WordPress sites for multiple clients. I handled front-end styling and system setup (typograpy, color palette, spacing, breakpoints and interactive states), made layouts responsive, and set up/tuned components to match design across devices.


## WordPress projects
### NYC Media Responsive

These were short and fast paced projects, no communication channel with the design team, designs were provided and excecuted as they came.
