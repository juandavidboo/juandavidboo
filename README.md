# 🔮 Juan David | Frontend Developer

With a background in graphic design, I build responsive, accessible UIs with performance and SEO in mind. My work spans modern frontend technologies (React, Next.js, Redux, TypeScript, Tailwind) as well as WordPress implementations, translating design systems into clean, maintainable interfaces.

## 🐴 MuleSoft

During my time at MuleSoft I worked on several frontend initiatives across their learning and marketing ecosystem, including platform migrations, component libraries, and UX improvements for training.mulesoft.com and related properties. Much of the work happened in highly constrained LMS/CMS environments, requiring isolated components, careful architecture, and cross-team collaboration.

### Mega-menu (modular build)

A fully modular, self-contained mega-menu built as a technical and branding update for MuleSoft.  
The requirement was to inject a large, content-heavy navigation component into four different websites without conflicting with their CSS, JavaScript, or existing frameworks.

The build uses a component-based architecture with Handlebars partials and selectively imported Bootstrap modules—only the pieces required for layout and interactions. The result is a responsive, accessible menu with smooth animations, keyboard navigation, and complete isolation from host environments.

🔗 **Live isolated build:**  
- [Mulesoft developer menu](https://megamenu-mule.vercel.app/)  

**Key aspects:**

**Modularization & Assembly**
- Component architecture using Handlebars partials  
- Atomic-style structure for maintainability  
- Independent development and testing  
- Cherry-picked Bootstrap modules (grid, utilities, buttons)

**Optimization & Weight Reduction**
- ~70% smaller than full Bootstrap (≈15KB vs 120KB)  
- Selective Sass imports  
- Automatic CSS/JS inlining (zero HTTP requests)  
- Terser minification and build-time tree-shaking

**Multi-Site Injection**
- Standalone HTML output with fully inlined assets  
- Zero runtime dependencies  
- CMS-agnostic deployment
