# Juan David
## Frontend developer

Having a graphic design background I code responsive, accessible UI with performance and SEO in mind. I work across WordPress and React, translating design systems into clean components. This portfolio highlights team projects I helped ship at agencies and in-house.

### Freelance work

Agency building WordPress sites for multiple clients. I handled front-end styling and system setup (typograpy, color palette, spacing, breakpoints and interactive states), made layouts responsive, and set up/tuned components to match design across devices.

I’m putting together a list of projects to showcase my work. I’ll clearly note my contributions to be precise and avoid attributing others’ work to myself. Listing them below the company or agency I coded it for. Because some are live projects that have evolved over time, not all of them have received proper maintainance or could even look broken at some point by now.

#### WordPress - NYC Media Responsive

These were short and fast paced projects, no communication channel to provide design feedback, designs were provided and excecuted as they came.
